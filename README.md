# Challenge_15
Upload of the Lambda_function.py code and 2 videos showing how the Amazon Lex works and then with Amazon Lambda functionality attached.  
The first video - giphy_Part1 - shows the basic Amazon Lex function via the chat bot test.  
The second video - giphy_Part2 - shows the same Amazon Lex function with Amazon Lambda functionality enabled.  

The second video got cut off a hair short but the full functionality set worked.  (Ignore the white noise in the Part 2 video)

The Lambda_function.py is the code given as a part of the Challenge 15 with additional coding included to:

1. The value of age should be greater than zero and less than 65.

3. The value of investment_amount should be greater than or equal to 5000.

Complete the starter code so that once the intent is fulfilled, the bot responds with an investment recommendation based on the selected risk level, as follows:

1. None: “100% bonds (AGG), 0% equities (SPY)”

2. Low: “60% bonds (AGG), 40% equities (SPY)”

3. Medium: “40% bonds (AGG), 60% equities (SPY)”

4. High: “20% bonds (AGG), 80% equities (SPY)”

All functionality worked well in testing.
